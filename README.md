# Code Challenge

I created a ReactJS web application for this coding challenge and was able to complete:

* I created a button component using Hooks and useState to alternate the text of the button.
* I created a component to run the generate function to map props.points. To demonstrate I was able to run the generate function, I displaied the points on the screen.
* I added a static sample SVG graphic with a <path> element.


As of now, I was not able to manipulate the array from generate() to work as an inline SVG graphic using <path> elements to draw the waveform shape.

My next steps going forward would be:

* Manipulate the generated points into a usable <path> element.
* Connecting the Button component to enable the manipulation of the waveform.
* Lastly comply with all style guide requirements.
